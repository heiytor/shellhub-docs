# Recovery Email

- Recovery email has been available since `v0.16.0`.

:::note
Enterprise and community edition users will not be able to recover access on
their own using a recovery email. You need to contact the administrator of the
server instance.
:::

If you have an account on ShellHub [Cloud](https://cloud.shellhub.io), the
recovery email is your last resort to regain access to your account.

While not required at registration, once provided, you cannot reset it to a
blank email. We do not send any verification email to this address, but we
assume it is a valid address. The same email address can be used by multiple
users.
